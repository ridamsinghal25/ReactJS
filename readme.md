# ReactJS Learning Repository

This repository contains the projects and code I completed while following the **ReactJS course** by Hitesh Choudhary sir on [Chai aur code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) channel. This course helped me build a solid foundation in ReactJS, covering various topics from basics to advanced concepts.

## Course Overview

The **ReactJS** course by Hitesh Choudhary is designed for beginners to intermediate developers who want to learn React from scratch. The course covers the core concepts of React, such as:

- JSX and Component-based architecture
- Props and State
- Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Routing with React Router
- Context API for state management
- Handling forms and user inputs
- API calls and working with asynchronous code
- Deployment and optimization

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Frontend library for building UI components
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Programming language used for logic and functionality
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Markup and styling
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages
- **Context API**: For managing global state in larger projects
- **Axios/Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to APIs
- **Tailwind**: CSS frameworks for styling

## What I Learned

Throughout this course, I gained a deep understanding of the following concepts:

- **React Components**: How to break UI into reusable pieces.
- **State Management**: Using `useState` and `useEffect` to handle local component state.
- **Routing**: Implementing navigation between different views/pages using `react-router-dom`.
- **Handling Forms**: Managing user inputs and form submissions.
- **API Integration**: Fetching data from external APIs and handling responses.
- **Context API**: Managing global state without third-party libraries like Redux.
- **Deploying React Apps**: Deployment techniques and optimization for production.
